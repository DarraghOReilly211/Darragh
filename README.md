# About Me

Hi, I'm **Darragh O'Reilly**, a Computer Science graduate from **Dublin City University** with a strong passion for software development and continuous learning.  
I thrive on solving complex problems, building scalable solutions, and constantly expanding my skill set through new technologies, projects, and contributions.

I’m actively working on personal projects, exploring different programming languages, and refining my development practices to grow as a versatile engineer.  
As a **personal preference for my personal projects**, I don’t use ChatGPT. Instead, I focus on developing my own skills and deepening my understanding of software design and engineering. Because of this, many of my repos include detailed documentation and drawings of my thought process—not just the finished result.

## 🎯 Learning & Focus

- **Revising Core Skills:** Java, Python, JavaScript, C, C++, algorithms/data structures, CSS/HTML, binary trees  
- **Currently Exploring:** Optimization, Spring Boot, cyber-security fundamentals  
- **Next Areas to Deepen:**
  - *Git & GitHub Workflows* → branching strategies (trunk-based vs GitFlow), Conventional Commits, semantic versioning, release automation with `semantic-release`, reusable workflows, matrix builds, caching (`actions/cache`), job/step outputs, workflow concurrency, environment protection rules.  
  - *CI/CD & DevOps* → Docker basics → multi-stage builds → Compose; artifact/version pipelines; dependency scanning; SBOM generation.  
  - *Testing Discipline* → unit/integration/E2E, property-based testing, contract tests, test fixtures/mocks, coverage as a *signal*, not a goal.  
  - *Observability* → structured logs, metrics, tracing; OpenTelemetry basics.  
  - *Systems Design* → queues, rate-limiting, idempotency, backpressure, eventual consistency, CAP trade-offs.  
  - *Performance* → profiling (CPU/heap), async I/O patterns, caching layers (in-proc, Redis), SQL query plans and indexes.  
  - *Security Hygiene* → secrets management, least-privilege, SAST/DAST, dependency updates, supply-chain basics.  
  - *Cloud & Databases* → AWS (IAM, S3, Lambda), Postgres internals (VACUUM, EXPLAIN), transactions & isolation levels.  
- **Interests:** Backend architecture, developer tooling, DX  
- **Open to Collaboration On:** Testing tools, small OSS utilities
